## 7 Steps for Cracking the Algorithms

1. Practice on Paper
    - Write pseudo code on paper then copy into your IDE to see what you missed
    - Learn from the mistakes you make

1. Do Mock Challenges
    - Use tools like LeetCode to practice common algorithms and interview questions

1. Listen to Every Detail
    - Think about what they are telling you and ask clarifying questions
    - Ask questions to determine the constraints, edge cases, different personas, time/space complexity requirements
    - Write a list of assumptions

1. Draw a Specific and Sufficiently Large Example
    - You can use this to validate your assumptions and test your algorithm

1. Design and Algorithm and Optimize
    - Don't optimize right away

1. Write Beautiful Code
    - Modularize the problem

1. Test Your Code
    - Read through the code line by line
    - Analyze input and output
    - Scrutinize parts of the code
    - Speak aloud and explain your thoughts
    - Check for errors
    - Write small test cases
    - Write tests for edge cases
    - Write negative tests for invalid input

## Algorithms

### Questions to Ask

- What is the input format and expected output format? Can you provide an example?
- Are there any specific runtime or space complexity requirements?
- Are there edge cases?
- Are there any specific data structures/algorithms that should be used or avooided?
- Is this a standalone problem or does it have an relation to a larger system?
- How should unexpected input be handled?

### Complexity Ranking

- The complexity of an algorithm is equal to the maximum complexity of all sub-componenets (e.g. n^3+n^2+n = O(n^3))
- Avoid factorial and exponential complexity
- Work to decrease the complexity of the algorithm starting with the most complex component
- Use memoization to decrease complexity if applicable and space complexity is not constrained

### Solutions

- Brute Force
- Memoization
- Two Pointer
- Sliding Window
- Searching and Sorting
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Pattern Search
- Greedy Algorithms
